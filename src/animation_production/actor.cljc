  "AnimationOpsActor — the JSIC 4113 独立アニメーション制作 (independent
  animation production studio) actor as a `langgraph.graph/state-graph`
  (per ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section). One graph run = one
  production operation request (intake → advise → govern → decide →
  commit/hold, with a human-approval interrupt for escalated proposals). No
  infinite internal loop; checkpointed per superstep so an interrupted run
  can resume after human sign-off.

  ```text
  :intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit           (:ok? true)
                                             +-> :request-approval  (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                             +-> :hold              (:hard? true)
  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the AnimationOpsAdvisor can never directly
  commit a record the AnimationProductionGovernor refuses — every
  commit-record! call is gated behind `:decide`, and assemble commits carry
  the actual anime cut plan (`animation-production.governor/build-cut-plan`,
  built from kotoba-lang/anime's `anime.production/layer-specs`) so what was
  approved is exactly what was assembled."
