(ns animation-production.store
  "SSoT for the JSIC 4113 独立アニメーション制作 (independent animation
  production studio) sole-proprietor actor. Store is a protocol injected
  into the `animation-production.actor` StateGraph — `MemStore` is the
  default, deterministic, zero-dep backend; a Datomic/kotoba-server-backed
  implementation can be swapped in without touching the actor or governor
  (itonami actor pattern, per ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section).

  Domain:

    production — a registered animation production (:production/id, rights
                 clearance flags :subjects-consented? / :rights-cleared?)
    record     — a committed operating record under a production (assemble,
                 publish) — written ONLY via commit-record!, never mutated
                 in place
    ledger     — an append-only audit trail of every proposal/verdict/
                 disposition, regardless of outcome (commit or hold)")
